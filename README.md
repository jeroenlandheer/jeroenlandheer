# Oh, Hello! ðŸ˜€

I'm Jeroen Landheer, a full-stack developer with over 25 years experience in various programming languages. My speciality is software and systems architecture, 
building systems from the ground up or modernizing existing systems so they can be maintained again with the latest and greatest tools and platforms. 

I lead a small development team at Bintelligence, we create custom solutions for our clients.
